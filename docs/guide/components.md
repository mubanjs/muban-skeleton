# Components

What is a site without components? In Muban - like most modern frontend frameworks - everything is a component.
From the biggest page to the smallest atom, all of them - and most are composed of - components.

## Component files and folders

Within the Muban skeleton we have set on a standard way of writing, organizing and using components, based on lessons
learned while working with it. If you wish, you're free to divert from this in your own project. Even then it is still
useful to know why we went this way.

### Folders

All components reside in the `/src/components/` folder. Not for any technical reason, but purely for organisation.
The default structure follows the atomic design principle of dividing components between atoms, molecules,
organisms and templates. Feel free to to change this and organize them any way you feel, since this decision is project specific.

Each component has its own folder to contain all the source files related to this component. At its core these are:
the TypeScript component, the template and the styles. But other files like storybook stories, mock data or included assets
can also be included here.

A component folder has the same name as its component, but written in [`snake-case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).

```
/src
  /components
    /atoms
      /my-atom-component
        ...files
      /my-other-atom
        ...files

    /my-component
      ...files
    /my-other-component
      ...files
```

### Source files

A component can have one or more source files, where each type is optional[^1], depending on the situation.
Important note to keep in mind is that the TypeScript component and the template must be kept in separate files,
because, in most cases, the template files are only used during development and for preview builds.

[^1]: This depends on how we are going to include SCSS files by default.

#### TypeScript Component

This file is the actual component that gets initialized to make an HTML element interactive.

It uses `PascalCase` for both the filename and the export.

We have chosen to use named exports instead of default ones to be more explicit when importing and using them - keeping the names in sync.

```ts
// MyComponent.ts

export const MyComponent = defineComponent({
  name: 'my-component',
});
```

An additional export that can exist in a component file is a `lazy` export, this supports importing these components
lazily to allow code splitting.

```ts
// MyComponent.ts

export const MyComponent = defineComponent({ ... });

export const lazy = supportLazy(MyComponent);
```

In most cases **[TBD]**, this file also import the styles related to this component. Webpack will only include scss
files that are imported through components that are actually used.

```ts
// MyComponent.ts

import { defineComponent } from '@muban/muban';

import './MyComponent.styles.scss';

export const MyComponent = defineComponent({ ... });
```

Including child components can be done in 3 ways:

1. Through the `components` option - these are initialized automatically, but you can't interact with them.
   a. Directly referencing them - they are included in the main bundle
   b. using the `lazy` function - these components are code-splitted, and only loaded if a matching `data-component`
   element exists in the HTML.
2. Using the `refComponent` or `refComponents` selector, allowing you to read props or apply bindings to these
   components.

```ts
// MyComponent.ts

export const MyComponent = defineComponent({
  name: 'my-component',
  components: [
    // 1.a
    MyChildComponent,
    // 1.b
    lazy('my-child-component', () => import(/* webpackExports: "lazy" */ '../MyChildComponent/MyChildComponent')),
  ],
  refs: {
    // 2
    myChildComponent: refComponent(MyChildComponent),
  },
  setup({ refs }) {
    return [
      bind(resf.myChildComponent, { ... }),
    ];
  },
});

// MyChildComponent.ts

export const MyChildComponent = defineComponent({
  name: 'my-child-component'
});
```

::: tip Optional
TypeScript components are not required - sometimes you have partials that only have templates (and styles), but don't require
any interactions or data bindings.
:::

#### Template

Because we love TypeScript, our templates are just typed functions that return an HTML string. Nesting templates is
as easy as calling those functions and passing the right parameters.

In storybook, we use the story Args to render individual component templates.

For our preview pages, we use page data functions to pass to our application template, which passes down the data to
its child components, where they use it, and pass down the rest, until we reached the last atom templates.

As said above, templates are only used during development, or when creating a previous build - completely
disconnected from the production HTML that is generated by something else. That's why templates live in their own
separate files.

It uses `PascalCase`, similar to the JS Component, and append `.template` after it. It exports a typed template function
and the Props `type` to use in parent components and story files.

To clearly indicate that the template is separate from the JS Component, and the props belong to the template function,
we both append `Template` to their names.

The `type` is `PascalCase` to follow the TypeScript conventions.

The template function is `camelCase` to follow the JavaScript conventions.

```ts
// MyComponent.template.ts

import { html } from '@muban/template';

export type MyComponentTemplateProps = MyChildComponentProps & {
  prop1: string;
  prop2?: boolean;
};

export function myComponentTemplate(
  { prop1, prop2, childProp }: MyComponentTemplateProps,
  ref?: string
): string {
  return html`
    <div data-component=${MyComponent.displayName} data-ref=${ref} data-prop=${prop2}>
      <!-- your component html -->
      <h1>${prop1}</h1>

      <!-- include child template -->
      ${myChildComponentTemplate({ childProp }, 'child-ref')}
    </div>
  `;
}
```

Some other things to note;

- So you don't have to repeat any typings, or worry about them getting out of sync, try to reference Prop types of
  child components a much as possible. Use `Pick` or `Omit` if you only need some of those specified props.

- Always have a container element (doesn't have to be a `div`) that includes the `data-component` attribute, with the
  same value as the `name` property you give your Component. To keep these in sync, you reference the `displayName` on
  the exported Component.
- Except for the root component, it's good practice receiving a `ref` parameter from the parent template and include
  it as a `data-ref` attribute in the same tag as the `data-component` attribute. This will make sure the parent can
  choose to specifically target this child component to apply bindings to.
- Passing a `ref` as second parameter to child templates is completely optional.

::: tip Optional
The use of templates in Muban is optional. If you already have existing HTML, either statically or as part of
existing website or CMS, it might not be sensible to duplicate everything locally as well. In those cases, you would
only write TypeScript components and styles, and won't use storybook or the dev server at all.
:::

#### Stylesheet

This file contains the styles that style the html for this component. Additionally, it can "override" styles from
child components it knows it will include.

It uses `PascalCase`, similar to the TypeScript component, and append `.styles` after it. The component is
scoped with its `data-component` attribute, which is required in the HTML for each component.

```scss
// MyComponent.styles.scss

[data-component='my-component'] {
  // styles

  [data-component='my-other-component'] {
    // override styles of all child components of that type
  }

  [dat-ref='specific-component-instance'] {
    // override styles of a single targeted child component
  }
}
```

::: tip
Because the Muban library is impartial about how you implement your styling, it is up to each project to decide how to
write stylesheets, and how to bundle them. In this skeleton, we've chosen SCSS.

- Using "css-in-js" does not make sense if your HTML is generated on the server.
- Going full post-css might still miss out on some useful features that SCSS offers.

However, if your team decides to use something else for styling, that's perfectly possible.
:::

::: warning
There are 3 ways to include your scss files to make them end up in your output bundle, each having their own downsides:

1. **Import your styles in the Template files** - since styles are there to enhance your HTML, linking them from the
   template files feels like the sensible option. It does require a separate build step to extract all those styles
   from the templates.

   In some cases however - either at the start of the project, or somewhere near the end - you might choose to not
   use these local templates anymore, but instead use the server
   rendered pages. Keeping the local and server templates in sync might take too much effort (with the main reason to
   keep storybook available). In that scenario, there aren't any template files to include your scss files anymore,
   which means you need to revert to option 3.

2. **Import your styles in the Component files** - However, some "partials" only include HTML and styles, and do not
   require any JavaScript logic to make them interactive. In that scenario, not every component has a file to include your scss
   files. This forces us to create files with empty components, or we have to revert to option 3.

3. **Glob all scss files in the project** - Setup wise this is the simplest option, but with the downside that if
   there are any unused components, they will still be included in the bundle. You could manually exclude them from
   the globbing pattern, but that would never be in sync with the imports to the components, potentially risking missing
   out on styles for your pages.

**Currently, option 2 is implemented in this skeleton.**

### Supporting files

#### Stories

Muban has its own storybook framework, which is included by default in this skeleton.

The story file uses `PascalCase`, mimicking the TypeScript component, with a `.stories` suffix.

```ts
// MyComponent.stories.ts

import type { Story } from '@muban/storybook';
import type { MyComponentTemplateProps } from './MyComponent.template';
import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';
import { myComponentTemplate } from './MyComponent.template';

export default {
  title: 'MyComponent',
  argTypes: {
    // Configure your props
  },
};

export const Default: Story<ButtonTemplateProps> = {
  render() {
    return {
      component: MyComponent,
      template: myComponentTemplate,
    }
  },
  args: {
    prop1: 'hello',
    prop2: true,
    childProp: 'awesome',
  }
};
```
